Can I use these Assets in commercial works?
You certainly can as these models are under the CC0 licence. 
This license gives you the freedom to use the Assets as you see fit. 
There are no restrictions in how you use the Assets.

Feel free to credit thebasemesh.com in your project but it’s not mandatory. 
I would however, ask you to use the meshes in the spirit in which they are created, 
and not to put them behind a paywall unless you have altered them in a significant way.​

“You can copy, modify, distribute and perform the work, even for commercial purposes, 
all without asking permission.”
